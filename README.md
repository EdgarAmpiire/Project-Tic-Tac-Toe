# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Ruby CLI Game)

This is a simple **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** built in Ruby, playable in the command line. It allows players to take turns, enter moves, and automatically checks for wins or draws.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game runs in the terminal
- Each player is prompted to enter their name and take turns
- The board updates after every move
- The game checks for a win or draw after each turn
- When the game ends, the result is displayed
